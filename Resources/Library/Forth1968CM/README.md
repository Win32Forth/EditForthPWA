# Forth1968CM

**Public domain.**

Charles H. Moore's original Forth, written in 1968 for the IBM 1130, running in [EditForthPWA](https://github.com/Win32Forth/EditForthPWA). The assembler and the 1130 simulator are written in Forth. The 1968 kernel and the Forth deck are the same files as in Forth-1968-CM.

The simulator uses the EditForth console. Printer output is `TYPE`. The keyboard is `KEY`. It calls `PAUSE` so the page can paint while it assembles, runs, and waits for a key.

## Run it

Open `Library/Forth1968CM/main.fth` and press Include. Then type:

```text
FORTH-1968
```

The console prints the assembly banner, the first disk record, and `HI THERE`. That session owns the console until Restart. Type each line. Names are four characters. The machine folds them to upper case. Space or Return ends a word. `$` prints `OK`. Restart ends the session.

## Typing

A dictionary name is four characters. `CONSOLE` is stored as `CONS`. When two words share those four letters, the later one runs. `CONSOLE` is later than `CONSTANT`, so `CONS` is `CONSOLE`.

`$` is an ordinary word. It is defined as `'OK' REPLY`, and it prints `OK`. The console shows the character you typed, and the 1130 prints it again, so the word can appear twice.

```text
$
'HELLO' REPLY
WARN
```

`WARN` replies `NO SUCH FILE`. Definitions begin with `.` and end with `,`:

```text
. HI 'HELLO' REPLY ,
```

`.` then `HI` needs a space. `.HI` is the word `.` followed by `HI`.

Words that do not print: `DUP` `DROP` `SWAP` `RAISE` `MINUS` `+` `-` `*` `/` `AND` `VALUE`. Type `DUP`, not `DUPLICATE`.

`FILL` reads another line from the keyboard. An unknown word is echoed and does not print an error.

`main.fth` checks the assembled kernel against the listing, packs `FO.FO` as the disk, and starts at the real entry point. The 1968 program then compiles and runs itself.
