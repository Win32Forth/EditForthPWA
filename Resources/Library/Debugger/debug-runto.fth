\ debug-runto.fth — Run to Here: UTF-8 offset → threaded cell IP
\ Loaded from debugger.fth after dbg-map.fth (needs DBG-MAP-* / DBG-CFA@).
\ Editor-only path: host sets RUNTO-OFF via kernel_debug_runto_request, then
\ pushes key 135; DBG-PAUSE-UI calls DBG-RUNTO-DO → (RUNTO-IP) + keep-armed GO.
\
\ Search order: SYSVOC (DBG-CFA@ / (RUNTO-IP) / …) + DEBUGGER (DBG-MAP-*).
\
\ Resolve searches the paused CFA first, then other mapped colon bodies in the
\ same VIEW file (so Run to drop in MAINX works while paused in MAIN).

ONLY FORTH ALSO SYSVOC ALSO DEBUGGER DEFINITIONS

\ Find first map cell whose span contains target UTF-8 file offset. -1 if none.
